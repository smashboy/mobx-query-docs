description: Install mobx-query and its required peer dependencies.

## Install mobx-query

```npm
npm install @mobx-query/core
```

## Peer Dependencies

mobx-query requires the following peer dependencies:

| Package                 | Purpose                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `@tanstack/react-query` | Server-state caching, refetching, and mutations      |
| `mobx`                  | Observable state and reactive computed properties    |
| `mobx-react-lite`       | React bindings — the `observer()` HOC for components |

```npm
npm install @tanstack/react-query mobx mobx-react-lite
```

<Callout>
  If you already have these packages in your project, you can skip the peer
  dependency installation step. mobx-query is compatible with **MobX 6+**,
  **mobx-react-lite 3+**, and **TanStack Query v5**.
</Callout>

## TypeScript Configuration

mobx-query is written in TypeScript and ships with full type definitions — no additional `@types/*` packages are needed.

### Decorators

mobx-query entities use the [TC39 decorator proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) (stage 3) with the `accessor` keyword. Make sure your `tsconfig.json` is configured to support them:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "experimentalDecorators": false,
    "useDefineForClassFields": true
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Do **not** enable `experimentalDecorators`. mobx-query uses the modern TC39
  decorators, which are incompatible with the legacy TypeScript decorator
  implementation.
</Callout>

## Verify Installation

Create a quick smoke test to verify everything is wired up:

```ts title="verify.ts"
import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { MQClient } from "@mobx-query/core";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const client = new MQClient({
  context: { queryClient },
  entities: [],
  rootStore: () => ({}),
});

console.log("✅ mobx-query is installed correctly!");
```

Run this file — if you see the success message, you're good to go.
